Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.

1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   
  Utilizing JUnit testing allows me to confirm that the code is functioning as intended. 
  Code is kept secure and efficiency by utilizing DRY code and following best practices for writing secure code. 

2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
   Understanding and implementing client/user requirements is extremely important when building the requested software. 
   Breaking the program down in to very specific requirements help ensure that both the client and developer understand the requirements in the same way. 
   
3) How do I approach designing software?

  I first review the requirements and get a general full picture idea of what it is I am going to be developing. 
  Once I have this information, I break the project down in to more manageable smaller chunks, testing the code for functionality along the way.
